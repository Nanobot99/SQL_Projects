# SQL_Projects
Within this I have my SQL projects that I have done based on publicly available datasets
You will find cycle_sales.sql which has all the questions and queries to solve them.
Please download the following csv files which are part of the database:
1. brands.csv, 2. categories.csv, 3. customers.csv, 4. order_items.csv, 5. orders.csv, 6. products.csv, 7. staffs.csv, 8. stocks.csv, 9. stores.csv
After downloading them, you will need to import them into SQL. I have performed the task using MySQL. All queries are written in accordence to MySQL.
